Prevalence is an estimate of how many people experienced homelessness at a particular point-in-time. The ABS uses six homeless operational groups to present the estimates of homelessness. Estimates are also presented for selected groups of people who may be marginally housed and whose living arrangements are close to the statistical boundary of homelessness and who may be at risk of homelessness. <br/>\nData is by SA4 2016 boundaries. Periodicity: 5 yearly. <br/>\nFor more information visit the <a href='http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2049.0Explanatory%20Notes12016?OpenDocument' 'target='_blank' >Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa4_code16","type":"String","title":"SA4 code 2016","description":"SA4 code 2016.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"hl_p_boading_houses","type":"Integer","title":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons living in boarding houses","description":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons living in boarding houses.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"hl_p_homeless_tot","type":"Integer","title":"Homeless Operational Group-All homeless persons","description":"Homeless Operational Group-All homeless persons.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"hl_p_improv_dwell_tent_so","type":"Integer","title":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons living in improvised dwellings, tents, or sleeping out","description":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons living in improvised dwellings, tents, or sleeping out.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"hl_p_oth_temp_lodgings","type":"Integer","title":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons in other temporary lodgings","description":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons in other temporary lodgings.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"hl_p_sever_crwd_dwell","type":"Integer","title":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons living in 'severely' crowded dwellings","description":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons living in 'severely' crowded dwellings.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"hl_p_supp_accom","type":"Integer","title":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons in supported accommodation for the homeless","description":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons in supported accommodation for the homeless.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"hl_p_temp_oth_hholds","type":"Integer","title":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons staying temporarily with other households","description":"Homeless Operational Group-Persons staying temporarily with other households.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"omh_p_marg_hsed_cpark","type":"Integer","title":"Other Marginal Housing-Persons who are marginally housed in caravan parks","description":"Other Marginal Housing-Persons who are marginally housed in caravan parks","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"omh_p_oth_crwd_dwell","type":"Integer","title":"Other Marginal Housing-Persons living in other crowded dwellings","description":"Other Marginal Housing-Persons living in other crowded dwellings.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"omh_p_oth_impor_dwell","type":"Integer","title":"Other Marginal Housing-Persons in other improvised dwellings","description":"Other Marginal Housing-Persons in other improvised dwellings.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa4_name_2016","type":"String","title":"SA4 name 2016","description":"SA4 name 2016.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"sa4_code16","geoLevel":"sa4_2016","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[96.81676569599999,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977],"featureType":"country","featureInstance":"au","featureName":"Australia","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":[]}}
